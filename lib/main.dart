//Some uses of variables

// ignore_for_file: unused_local_variable

/*Variables in programming are the basis for temporarily storing data 
within the program during its execution.*/
//We use variables to reuse a value more than once.
//To update the value while the program is running
//To store user input

//create variable--> 1.data type--->2.name variable = The name of the place where the value is stored
/*
Some rules for naming a variable:

1. The name must begin with a letter or a symbol (_) only.
2. It can contain letters, numbers, or a _, but must not begin with a number or a _.
3. It must not be the same name as a Dart reserved word.
